 The answer to both is yes, but each is a separate solution.

 There are four methods that I know. The first three require you
additionally
 move gpg.conf. All require that you move the three keyring files:
pubring.gpg,
 secring.gpg, & trustdb.gpg.

 1) Add --homedir=<foo> to _every_ invocation of gpg. Fine if you don't ever make
	tpyos and don't forget to add it.

 2) Set the environment variable GNUPGHOME to the location. Best done
	in the User variables part of the Environment variable panel of System properties.
	(Control panel --> System --> Advanced --> 'Environment Variables' button)

 3) Change the value of HomeDir in the HKCU\Software\Gnu\GnuPG key.
	Some  are uncomfortable directly editing the Registry. Later runs of the installer
	may or may not mess with this. Most likely not, feeling lucky?

 4) Set values in gpg.conf to redirect the location. (My preferred method)
 Add the following lines to gpg.conf:

    no-default-keyring
    primary-keyring R:\pubring.gpg
    secret-keyring  R:\secring.gpg
    trustdb-name    R:\trustdb.gpg

 You may also need
    keyring         R:\pubring.gpg

 Depending on the size of your portable storage device, you may find
organizing with directories a bit easier. I use O:\GnuPG and O:\PGP for my keyrings

 BTW, I may have forgotten to mention it over the weekend. Please turn HTML
 composition off completely with (Open)PGP. It produces messages that
usually will fail signature verification. It will sometimes work, but rarely.

 format=flowed is another message composition "feature" that tends to break
 signatures. It's most common in Mozilla mailers.
